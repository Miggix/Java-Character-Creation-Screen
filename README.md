# Java-Character-Creation-Screen
Character Creation Screen
This application creates a simple Character Creation Screen as found in many different
RPGs (role playing games.) This screen will allow the user to pick and save a character’s specifications from a list
of options.The interface has the following:
- (Radio Buttons) The user may select among three options for the character’s Gender
o Male
o Female
o Hermaphrodite
- (A Drop-Down List) The user may select from among the following Races for the character:
o Warrior
o Barbarian
o Mage
o Thief
o Priest
- (A Text Field) The user may enter his/her character’s Name, which must be at least one character long,
but may be as long as 10 characters
- (Sliders and a label) The user has 100 skill points to spend across 4 different passive skills. The user will
see a label with “100” on it originally.
 Whenever he/she slides a slider to increase the skill points in that skill, the points are taken from
the 100 points (or however many are remaining.)
 When the user decreases the skill points in a particular area, they are returned to the “points left
to spend” pool, and this is reflected in the label as well. The remaining points will always be
displayed in this label.
 If the player runs out of points to spend, he/she should not be able to increase the points in any
skill area until points are returned to the pool, and are available to be spent.
 The four (4) skill areas are as follows:
 Intelligence
 Dexterity
 Strength
 Wisdom.
 There will be a Menu System for opening and saving a saved character
 The menu bar should contain two titles:
 File
 Options.
 Under the File Menu, there are two options:
 Open a saved character
 Save a character.
 Under the Options Menu, there are two options:
 Reset All
 Exit
